Certainly, expanding on the milestones within your revised project plan provides clarity on the scope and depth of each phase. Here's a detailed explanation for each milestone:

### Foundation in RSL and RSL* (February)

#### Description
This phase is dedicated to establishing a solid understanding of RSL (RAISE Specification Language) and its extension, RSL*. You will immerse yourself in the syntax, semantics, and key differences between the two languages. This involves a comprehensive study of official documentation, academic papers, and any available tutorials that delve into both the foundational and advanced aspects of these specification languages. The goal is to not only grasp the theoretical underpinnings but also to appreciate the practical applications and nuances that RSL* introduces over RSL. Documenting your findings and insights will be crucial, as this knowledge will form the backbone of the entire project, influencing decisions in subsequent phases.

### Exploration of F# and Scala (First Week of March)

#### Description
In this milestone, you aim to evaluate F# and Scala for their potential to implement the typechecker efficiently. The focus will be on learning the syntax, understanding the type systems, and exploring the functional programming paradigms offered by both languages. This exploration will involve engaging with interactive tutorials, coding exercises, and small projects to get hands-on experience. The decision on which language to proceed with will hinge on factors like language expressiveness, ecosystem support, and compatibility with the project's goals. A detailed report will justify the choice, based on a comparative analysis of both languages' strengths and weaknesses in the context of typechecker development.

### Identify and Work on Problematic Constructs

#### Description
This phase concentrates on dissecting RSL and RSL* to identify constructs that present ambiguities or complexities, potentially hindering the parsing and type checking processes. Through a meticulous examination of the languages' grammars and construct usage, you will pinpoint areas prone to misinterpretation or errors. The outcome will be a catalog of these problematic constructs, accompanied by proposed solutions or alternative approaches to mitigate the identified issues. This task demands a deep dive into language theory and practical problem-solving to ensure the robustness and accuracy of the eventual typechecker.

### Experimentation Handling Constructs in Both Languages

#### Description
Armed with a list of problematic constructs, this milestone involves experimental coding sessions in either F# or Scala (based on the earlier selection). The aim is to prototype solutions to the identified problems, testing different strategies for handling the ambiguous or complex constructs effectively. This hands-on experimentation phase is crucial for translating theoretical solutions into practical, workable code snippets. It will likely involve a cycle of coding, testing, and refining approaches based on the outcomes, with the ultimate goal of defining a clear, efficient method for dealing with the languages' intricacies in the typechecker.

### Build AST by Hand (Design)

#### Description
Designing the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) by hand is a critical step towards a structured representation of RSL and RSL* syntax within the typechecker. This milestone focuses on outlining the nodes and structure of the AST to accurately reflect all language constructs, prioritizing modularity and extensibility to accommodate future enhancements. The design process will involve a detailed analysis of both languages to ensure that the AST can capture their full syntax and semantics. This phase requires a balance of theoretical knowledge and practical design skills to create an AST framework that is both comprehensive and navigable.

### Iterative Development of Lexer, Parser, and Typechecker

#### Description
This milestone marks the transition from design to development, with the iterative creation of the lexer, parser, and typechecker. Starting with basic constructs and progressively incorporating more complex elements, this approach allows for continuous refinement and testing at each stage. The development process will be guided by the previously designed AST and the insights gained from handling problematic constructs. Each iteration aims to enhance the tool's capabilities, with regular testing against sample inputs to ensure accuracy and reliability. The iterative nature of this phase encourages flexibility and adaptability in integrating new features and making improvements.

### Add Advanced Constructs in Future Iterations

#### Description
As the foundation of the lexer, parser, and typechecker solidifies, this milestone focuses on integrating advanced constructs from RSL and RSL* into the development process. This phase involves extending the tool's capabilities to fully support the comprehensive range of language features, including those identified as problematic or complex. The development work will be characterized by a blend of coding, testing, and refinement activities, with a focus on ensuring that the typechecker remains robust, efficient, and accurate in handling the full spectrum of language constructs.

### Documentation and Final Testing Milestones

#### Description
The culmination of the project involves two key activities: comprehensive documentation and exhaustive testing. The documentation will cover the entire development process, design decisions, implementation details, and user guidance, serving as a valuable resource for future users and developers. Final testing represents a critical evaluation phase, where the typechecker is subjected to a wide range of test cases to identify and rectify any remaining issues. This ensures that the tool is not only functional but also reliable and user-friendly, ready for deployment in real-world scenarios.

Each of these milestones is integral to the project's success, combining theoretical learning, practical experimentation, and meticulous development to create a robust typechecker for RSL and RSL*.
